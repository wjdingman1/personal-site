Thanks for taking the time to read this, my hope is that this gives you a more personal insight than just my [resume](resume.pdf)!

I'm currently living in Columbia, MD and have been a MD resident all my life. After graduating highschool, I attended UMD as a physics major and quickly found out at 17 I was not ready for the college experience just yet. I elected to take a couple years off school and work; some of the jobs I had were: drycleaning, dog kennel assistant, radiator salesman and many others.

After several years working I saved up enough money and enrolled at Towson University as a Business/Pre-Law major. My introduction to programming came through an elective CS course that I took to fulfill one of my graduation requirements...after the first week of that course, I was no longer interested in law. I went to the registrars office and switched my major to Computer Science.

I can't thank Towson University enough for my undergraduate experience. During my time there I was fortunate to win some scholarships, publish research and work closely with several of the professors from the computer science and mathematics departments. For any student reading this, just because you don't go to your state's flagship school or an Ivy doesn't mean you can't get an exceptional education.

Upon graduating I worked as a Software Engineer for two years at [Next Century Corporation](https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-tw-midsize-one-20191206-irc4cpw75zdkdjvbf2t6qidmwq-story.html) developing the MediFor system, a platform leveraging computer vision and image processing technologies to detect deepfakes and other pieces of manipulated media.

I'm currently at [Asymmetrik Ltd](https://asymmetrik.com/), working on their healthcare team developing cloud-optimized workflows for biological data processing, and pursuing a masters at Johns Hopkins University.

I consider myself a 'full-stack' software engineer even though that term has become very tired lately. My main tools and interests are Node, Golang, Vue, AWS and anything to do with Kubernetes/container technology.

When I'm not working I'm usually outside rock climbing, tinkering with new tech or at Bethany Beach, DE with friends and family.

Feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn or shoot me an email if you would like to know more!
