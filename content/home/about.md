Thanks for taking the time to read this, my hope is that this gives you a more personal insight than just my [resume](Resume-Spring22.pdf)!

I'm currently living in Columbia, MD and have been a MD resident all my life. Like many others, I had a non-linear path to software engineering which included: dropping out, working odd jobs, reenrolling and several changes of my major.

After undergrad I worked as a software engineer for two years at [Next Century Corporation](https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-tw-midsize-one-20191206-irc4cpw75zdkdjvbf2t6qidmwq-story.html) developing the MediFor system, a platform leveraging computer vision and image processing technologies to detect deepfakes and other pieces of manipulated media.

I'm currently at [Asymmetrik Ltd](https://asymmetrik.com/), working on their healthcare team in collaboration with [The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) to develop cloud optimized pipelines for processing sequenced genomic data at scale.

I have been fortunate to work in a variety of domains and I consider myself a 'generalist' who has no problem learning whatever I need in order to contribute. However, I'm most comfortable on the backend with in some mix of Javascript/Python/Go with Docker and Kubernetes sprinkled in.

When I'm not working I'm either rock climbing or studying towards my MS in computer science at Johns Hopkins.

Feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn or shoot me an email if you would like to know more!
