Thanks for taking the time to read this; my hope is that this gives you more personal insight than just my [resume](Resume-Spring22-updated.pdf)!

I'm currently living in Columbia, MD and have been an MD resident all my life. Like many others, I had a non-linear path to software engineering which included: dropping out, working odd jobs, reenrolling, and several changes to my major.

After undergrad I worked in the contracting space for several years with [Next Century Corporation](https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-tw-midsize-one-20191206-irc4cpw75zdkdjvbf2t6qidmwq-story.html), developing the MediFor system, and [Asymmetrik Ltd](https://asymmetrik.com/), collaborating with The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard to develop cloud-optimized pipelines for processing sequenced genomic data at scale.

Currently, I'm a senior software engineer at [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) working on their backend team developing solutions for autonomous cybersecurity. 

I have been fortunate to work in a variety of domains and I consider myself a 'generalist' who has no problem learning whatever I need in order to contribute. However, I'm most comfortable on the backend in some mix of Javascript/Python/Go with Docker and Kubernetes sprinkled in.

When I'm not working I'm either rock climbing or studying towards my MS in computer science at Johns Hopkins University.

Feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn or shoot me an email if you would like to know more!
